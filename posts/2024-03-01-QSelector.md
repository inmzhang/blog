title: "QSelector: A simple tool to select on chip easily"
author: Yiming Zhang
release: true
---

This simple tool is designed to alleviate the pain of manually typing qubit/coupler names in experimental scripts.

Through a visual interface, users can quickly select desired qubits/couplers and easily copy their list or dictionary 
with attribute values to the clipboard. This copied content can then be pasted directly into the experimental script.
