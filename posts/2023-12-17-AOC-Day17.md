Today's AOC puzzel is about _Single-Source Shortes Path_(SSSP) problem. It's a good
time for me to review the Dijkstra's algorithm. And I learned a new algorithm _A*_ 
to test against the former.

## The puzzel

Given the input as follow:

```text
2413432311323
3215453535623
3255245654254
3446585845452
4546657867536
1438598798454
4457876987766
3637877979653
4654967986887
4564679986453
1224686865563
2546548887735
4322674655533
```
We will start from the top-left to find a shortest weighted path to the bottom-right.
What's more, the path is constrained that it will not step back and the consequtive
steps in the same direction should be in range [n, m].

For example, given the range [1, 3] and the input above, we have the following shortest
path:

```text
2>>34^>>>1323
32v>>>35v5623
32552456v>>54
3446585845v52
4546657867v>6
14385987984v4
44578769877v6
36378779796v>
465496798688v
456467998645v
12246868655<v
25465488877v5
43226746555v>
```

Or, given the range [4, 10], we have the following shortest path instead:

```text
2>>>>>>>>1323
32154535v5623
32552456v4254
34465858v5452
45466578v>>>>
143859879845v
445787698776v
363787797965v
465496798688v
456467998645v
122468686556v
254654888773v
432267465553v
```

Before diving into the solution, we need to parse the input firstly:

```rust
let blocks: Vec<&[u8]> = input
    .split('\n')
    .map(str::as_bytes)
    .collect();

// we will need to use this for the algorithms
#[derive(Debug, PartialEq, Eq, PartialOrd, Ord, Hash, Clone, Copy)]
struct Node {
    direction: (i32, i32),
    position: (i32, i32),
}
```

## Dijkstra algorithm

Obviously, the problem can be solved with the variant of the most common 
shortest path finding algorithm: Dijkstra algorithm.

![Dijkstra algorithm][Dijkstra_Animation]

**Dijkstra algorithm** is widely used in shortest path finding problems, i.e.
network routing protocols and constructing syndrom graph for QEC decoding.
The following [pseudocodes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra%27s_algorithm) 
illustrates the basic of the algorithm:

```
function Dijkstra(Graph, source):
     dist[source] ← 0                           // Initialization

     create vertex priority queue Q

     for each vertex v in Graph.Vertices:
         if v ≠ source
             dist[v] ← INFINITY                 // Unknown distance from source to v
             prev[v] ← UNDEFINED                // Predecessor of v

         Q.add_with_priority(v, dist[v])

     while Q is not empty:                      // The main loop
         u ← Q.extract_min()                    // Remove and return best vertex
         for each neighbor v of u:              // Go through all v neighbors of u
             alt ← dist[u] + Graph.Edges(u, v)
             if alt < dist[v]:
                 dist[v] ← alt
                 prev[v] ← u
                 Q.decrease_priority(v, alt)

     return dist, prev
```

With the help of the _priority queue/heap_, the complexity of finding all the shortest path
each nodes of a complete graph is $O(Elog(V))$, where $E, V$ is the total number of edges
and vertices in the graph.

For the puzzel, we need to change the algorithm a bit to account for the direction and moving
constraints:

```rust
fn dijkstra(blocks: &[&[u8]], minstep: i32, maxstep: i32) -> u32 {
    let mut costs: HashMap<Node, i32> = HashMap::new();
    // BinaryHeap in std is a max heap
    // Then we need to store -cost
    let mut queue = BinaryHeap::from_iter([(
        0i32, // the cost
        Node {
            direction: (0, 0), // this is the edge case: starting point's direction is not fixed
            position: (0, 0),
        },
    )]);
    // The bounding box
    let max_col = blocks[0].len() as i32 - 1;
    let max_row = blocks.len() as i32 - 1;
    let end = (max_row, max_col);
    while let Some((cost, node)) = queue.pop() {
        // reach the end point
        if node.position == end {
            return -cost as u32;
        }
        // there is already a path with smaller cost
        if costs.get(&node).is_some_and(|&c| -cost > c) {
            continue;
        }
        // move to the next position
        for (dr, dc) in [(1, 0), (-1, 0), (0, 1), (0, -1)] {
            // dont step back and the forth direction have already been considered(see below)
            if node.direction == (dr, dc) || node.direction == (-dr, -dc) {
                continue;
            }
            let mut cost_next = -cost;
            for step in 1..=maxstep {
                let position = (node.position.0 + dr * step, node.position.1 + dc * step);
                // out of bound
                if position.0 < 0 || position.0 > max_row || position.1 < 0 || position.1 > max_col
                {
                    continue;
                }
                cost_next += (blocks[position.0 as usize][position.1 as usize] - b'0') as i32;
                let node_next = Node {
                    direction: (dr, dc),
                    position,
                };
                if minstep > step || *costs.get(&node_next).unwrap_or(&i32::MAX) <= cost_next {
                    continue;
                }
                costs.insert(node_next, cost_next);
                queue.push((-cost_next, node_next));
            }
        }
    }
    unreachable!()
}
```

## A* algorithm

A* algorithm can be seen as an extension of _Dijkstra algorithm_, it uses **heuristics** to guide
the search and achieves better performance(the efficiency depends on the choice of the heuristics).

![Astar algorithm][Astar_Animation]

Instead of exploring the edges with the minimum weight first, A* use the heuristics to combine the length
of path so far with the predicted length of path to the desitination.

The following pseudocodes describe the algorithm:
```
function reconstruct_path(cameFrom, current)
    total_path := {current}
    while current in cameFrom.Keys:
        current := cameFrom[current]
        total_path.prepend(current)
    return total_path

// A* finds a path from start to goal.
// h is the heuristic function. h(n) estimates the cost to reach goal from node n.
function A_Star(start, goal, h)
    // The set of discovered nodes that may need to be (re-)expanded.
    // Initially, only the start node is known.
    // This is usually implemented as a min-heap or priority queue rather than a hash-set.
    openSet := {start}

    // For node n, cameFrom[n] is the node immediately preceding it on the cheapest path from the start
    // to n currently known.
    cameFrom := an empty map

    // For node n, gScore[n] is the cost of the cheapest path from start to n currently known.
    gScore := map with default value of Infinity
    gScore[start] := 0

    // For node n, fScore[n] := gScore[n] + h(n). fScore[n] represents our current best guess as to
    // how cheap a path could be from start to finish if it goes through n.
    fScore := map with default value of Infinity
    fScore[start] := h(start)

    while openSet is not empty
        // This operation can occur in O(Log(N)) time if openSet is a min-heap or a priority queue
        current := the node in openSet having the lowest fScore[] value
        if current = goal
            return reconstruct_path(cameFrom, current)

        openSet.Remove(current)
        for each neighbor of current
            // d(current,neighbor) is the weight of the edge from current to neighbor
            // tentative_gScore is the distance from start to the neighbor through current
            tentative_gScore := gScore[current] + d(current, neighbor)
            if tentative_gScore < gScore[neighbor]
                // This path to neighbor is better than any previous one. Record it!
                cameFrom[neighbor] := current
                gScore[neighbor] := tentative_gScore
                fScore[neighbor] := tentative_gScore + h(neighbor)
                if neighbor not in openSet
                    openSet.add(neighbor)

    // Open set is empty but goal was never reached
    return failure
```

For the puzzel, I use the sum of costs for the `gscore` and the manhatten distance between current
node and the desitination as the `hscore`. Here is the code:

```rust
fn astar(blocks: &[&[u8]], minstep: i32, maxstep: i32) -> u32 {
    let start = Node::new((0, 0), (0, 0));
    let max_col = blocks[0].len() as i32 - 1;
    let max_row = blocks.len() as i32 - 1;
    let end = (max_row, max_col);
    let mut gscores: HashMap<Node, i32> = HashMap::from_iter([(start, 0)]);
    let mut queue = BinaryHeap::from_iter([(cal_cost(&start, 0, end), start)]);
    while let Some((cost, node)) = queue.pop() {
        if node.position == end {
            return -cost as u32;
        }
        for (dr, dc) in [(1, 0), (-1, 0), (0, 1), (0, -1)] {
            if node.direction == (dr, dc) || node.direction == (-dr, -dc) {
                continue;
            }
            let mut tentative_gscore = gscores[&node];
            for step in 1..=maxstep {
                let position = (node.position.0 + dr * step, node.position.1 + dc * step);
                if position.0 < 0 || position.0 > max_row || position.1 < 0 || position.1 > max_col
                {
                    continue;
                }
                tentative_gscore +=
                    (blocks[position.0 as usize][position.1 as usize] - b'0') as i32;
                let node_next = Node::new((dr, dc), position);
                if minstep > step
                    || *gscores.get(&node_next).unwrap_or(&i32::MAX) <= tentative_gscore
                {
                    continue;
                }
                gscores.insert(node_next, tentative_gscore);
                queue.push((cal_cost(&node_next, tentative_gscore, end), node_next));
            }
        }
    }
    unreachable!()
}
```

## Comparasion

The animation from wikipedia illustrates the difference between these two algorithm clearly:

![Dijkstra progress animation][Dijkstras_progress_animation]
_Dijkstra's algorithm_
![A* progress animation][Astar_progress_animation]
_A* algorithm_

The heuristics guides the A* algorithm to explore in the direction of the desitination node rather than 
all the directions uniformly as in Dijkstra's algorithm.

As above, I expected the A* implementation would be somewhat faster than the Dijkstra's one. 
However, when I benchmarked the code, the A* is ~2x slow! It might results from the non-uniform
distribution of the costs across the grid, so that the uniform manhatten heuristics is not a good
choice.

Here is the benchmark results for the part1 and part2 of the puzzel(the range is [1, 3] and [4, 10]):
